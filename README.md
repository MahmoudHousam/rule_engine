# Rule Engine
This repo is an advanced implementation for the JITAI project. For context relevancy, Just In Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI)
is a healthcare-tech solution that aims to optimize the use of smart watches' (e.g. Apple Watch, Garmin, Fitbit) data to generate
real-time nudges that direct the patient to a health activity to improve pro-active care using a rule engine that optimizes the combination of historical clinical data (diagnosis and medication adherence) and wearable data to either notify a patient to do 
specific activity or, in case of high risk events, notify the healthcare provider to take an action.
